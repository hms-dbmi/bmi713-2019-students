## Sampling Data from a Normal Distribution

The following snippet samples 1000 values from a Normal distribution and plots them.

```{r}
normal <- rnorm(1000)
plot(normal)
```

Plot the probability distribution with the `density` command.

```{r}
plot(density(normal))
```

## Sampling Data from a Uniform Distribution

Repeat the above steps for a uniform distribution, using the `runif` command.

The following snippet samples 1000 values from a uniform distribution and plots them.

```{r}
# ...
```

Plot the probability distribution with the `density` command.

```{r}
# ...
```
